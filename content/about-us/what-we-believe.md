1. Holding to Reformed Theology as set forth in the [Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms](https://www.pcaac.org/bco/westminster-confession/).
1. Bearing witness to the Gospel of grace personally, and through support of ministries of missions and evangelism.
1. Practicing loving care and accountability in the body of Christ, the Church, implemented within the practice of the Biblical structure of shepherding leadership.
1. Pursuing holiness of life, and discipleship development through ministries of teaching and service, with active prayerful dependence on Godâ€™s grace to produce the growth.
1. Practicing God-centered, Gospel-driven worship.
1. Cultivating generosity in stewardship for works of ministry and mercy within our community and world, including serving as a resource church for the Reformed faith in our region.
