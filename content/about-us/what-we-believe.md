# What We Believe

## We are committed to:

1. Believing the Bible as the inerrant, infallible, all sufficient, divinely inspired Word of God.
1. Holding to Reformed Theology as set forth in the [Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms](https://www.pcaac.org/bco/westminster-confession/).
1. Bearing witness to the Gospel of grace personally, and through support of ministries of missions and evangelism.
1. Practicing loving care and accountability in the body of Christ, the Church, implemented within the practice of the Biblical structure of shepherding leadership.
1. Pursuing holiness of life, and discipleship development through ministries of teaching and service, with active prayerful dependence on God’s grace to produce the growth.
1. Practicing God-centered, Gospel-driven worship.
1. Cultivating generosity in stewardship for works of ministry and mercy within our community and world, including serving as a resource church for the Reformed faith in our region.
1. Helping produce distinctively healthy, God-honoring families that pass the Christian faith to successive generations and impact our community and world for Christ.

## Beliefs about Worship

At Westminster we believe that worship is the entire experience of meeting and participating together as a body of believers to worship God.  In keeping with the doctrines of Reformed Faith and our denomination, we believe this includes reading the Bible, praying, singing, the preaching of the Bible, participating in the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and giving of tithes and offerings.

In accordance with Scripture, we believe worship is to be thoughtful, reverent, orderly, and joyful (1 Corinthians 14:40).  Our approach to music is to incorporate songs–old and new–that support the message, using a blend of instrumentation (Colossians 3:16).  We welcome everyone to join us in our Sabbath celebration every Sunday as we worship Jesus Christ and acknowledge Him as Lord and Savior.
